Here is a tailored Rego policy that addresses the specific AWS S3 operational best practices you mentioned, along with hardcoded JSON data that simulates Terraform output for testing the policies using OPA.

### Rego Policy for AWS S3 Best Practices

```rego
package aws_s3_compliance

# 1. Ensure S3 bucket allows only SSL requests
deny[msg] {
    input.s3_bucket.ssl_requests_only == false
    msg = sprintf("S3 Bucket %v does not enforce SSL requests only", [input.s3_bucket.name])
}

# 2. Ensure S3 bucket versioning is enabled
deny[msg] {
    input.s3_bucket.versioning_configuration.status != "Enabled"
    msg = sprintf("S3 Bucket %v does not have versioning enabled", [input.s3_bucket.name])
}

# 3. Ensure S3 bucket default encryption uses KMS
deny[msg] {
    input.s3_bucket.default_encryption != "aws:kms"
    msg = sprintf("S3 Bucket %v does not have KMS encryption enabled", [input.s3_bucket.name])
}

# 4. Ensure S3 bucket event notifications are enabled
deny[msg] {
    input.s3_bucket.event_notifications == null
    msg = sprintf("S3 Bucket %v does not have event notifications enabled", [input.s3_bucket.name])
}

# 5. Ensure the last backup recovery point was created
deny[msg] {
    input.s3_bucket.last_backup == null
    msg = sprintf("S3 Bucket %v does not have a recent backup recovery point", [input.s3_bucket.name])
}

# 6. Ensure S3 bucket lifecycle policy is configured
deny[msg] {
    input.s3_bucket.lifecycle_policy == null
    msg = sprintf("S3 Bucket %v does not have a lifecycle policy configured", [input.s3_bucket.name])
}

# 7. Ensure S3 meets restore time target
deny[msg] {
    input.s3_bucket.restore_time_target == false
    msg = sprintf("S3 Bucket %v does not meet the restore time target", [input.s3_bucket.name])
}

# 8. Ensure S3 resources are logically air-gapped in vault
deny[msg] {
    input.s3_bucket.air_gapped_vault == false
    msg = sprintf("S3 Bucket %v is not stored in a logically air-gapped vault", [input.s3_bucket.name])
}

# 9. Ensure S3 resources are protected by a backup plan
deny[msg] {
    input.s3_bucket.backup_plan_enabled == false
    msg = sprintf("S3 Bucket %v is not protected by a backup plan", [input.s3_bucket.name])
}

# 10. Ensure S3 version lifecycle policy is configured
deny[msg] {
    input.s3_bucket.version_lifecycle_policy == null
    msg = sprintf("S3 Bucket %v does not have a version lifecycle policy", [input.s3_bucket.name])
}

allow {
    not deny[_]
}
```

### Simulated Terraform JSON Input

```json
{
  "s3_bucket": {
    "name": "example-bucket",
    "ssl_requests_only": false,
    "versioning_configuration": {
      "status": "Disabled"
    },
    "default_encryption": "none",
    "event_notifications": null,
    "last_backup": null,
    "lifecycle_policy": null,
    "restore_time_target": false,
    "air_gapped_vault": false,
    "backup_plan_enabled": false,
    "version_lifecycle_policy": null
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Policies:
1. **SSL Requests Only**: Ensures that the bucket only accepts SSL-encrypted requests, securing data in transit.
2. **Versioning Enabled**: Enforces versioning to allow recovery from unintended modifications or deletions.
3. **KMS Encryption**: Requires default encryption with AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for enhanced data protection.
4. **Event Notifications**: Ensures that event notifications are enabled for tracking actions on the bucket.
5. **Backup Recovery Point**: Checks if a recent recovery point has been created for disaster recovery purposes.
6. **Lifecycle Policy**: Enforces a lifecycle policy to automatically manage object retention and transitions.
7. **Restore Time Target**: Ensures that the bucket can meet restore time objectives for compliance or business continuity.
8. **Air-Gapped Vault**: Confirms that the bucket is stored in a logically air-gapped vault for enhanced security.
9. **Backup Plan**: Ensures the bucket is covered by a backup plan for automated protection.
10. **Version Lifecycle Policy**: Verifies that version lifecycle management is in place to handle object versions.

### Running the Policy with OPA

Save both the Rego policy and JSON file, then run the following command to evaluate it using OPA:

```bash
opa eval -i input.json -d policy.rego "data.aws_s3_compliance"
```

This command will return any `deny` messages where the S3 bucket is non-compliant with the given policies.

If you need further modifications or additional checks, feel free to ask!
